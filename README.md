# Frontend Final Project - CS464P Portland State

by Ryan Filgas and Devon Fox

## Building the Project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

To make sure you can take advantage of the current [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) endpoint, create a `.env` file in the project's main directory and add your API key like so:

```
POLYGON_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

To obtain an API key, navigate to: [https://polygon.io/?auth=signup](https://polygon.io/?auth=signup) to signup and follow the prompts to receive your free API key.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

**Todo:** *read up on this to take advantage*
